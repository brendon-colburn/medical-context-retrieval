      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "Key points — guideline summary\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Whom to screen\n",
      "- There is broad agreement that average‑risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened for colorectal cancer [1][2].  \n",
      "- The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) specifically recommends screening all adults aged 50 to 75 years (Grade A) [2][3].  \n",
      "- The USPSTF recommends screening adults aged 45 to 49 years (Grade B) — i.e., offering screening to this younger group [3].  \n",
      "- For adults aged 76 to 85 years the USPSTF recommends selective screening based on overall health, prior screening history, and patient preferences (Grade C); the net benefit in this age group is small for those previously screened and larger for those never screened [3][4].  \n",
      "- For adults 86 years or older, evidence is lacking and competing causes of mortality likely preclude a survival benefit that would outweigh harms; routine screening is not supported by available evidence [5].\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Which screening strategies the USPSTF considers\n",
      "- The USPSTF’s assessment of net benefit applies to high‑sensitivity stool‑based tests, colonoscopy, computed tomography (CT) colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy [4].\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Recommended screening intervals (as reported in the available sources)\n",
      "- High‑sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT): every year [5].  \n",
      "- Stool DNA‑FIT (sDNA‑FIT): every 1 to 3 years [5].  \n",
      "- CT colonography: every 5 years [5].  \n",
      "- Flexible sigmoidoscopy: every 5 years [5].  \n",
      "- Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years combined with annual FIT is listed as an interval option in the source [5].\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Additional considerations and limitations of the provided information\n",
      "- The provided excerpts note multiple professional organizations’ alignment on screening ages and list the range of acceptable modalities, but do not provide full details about test performance characteristics, follow‑up of positive tests, or surveillance intervals after abnormal findings; those details are not available in the provided text and therefore cannot be stated here based on these sources alone [1][4][5].  \n",
      "- A specific recommended interval for screening colonoscopy is not provided in the excerpts you supplied (the USPSTF assessment includes colonoscopy among acceptable options, but an interval for colonoscopy is not listed in the provided passages) — this information is therefore not available from the provided sources [4][5].  \n",
      "- If there are any contradictions among organizations’ finer points (for example, starting age or preferred modality), those specifics are not fully shown in the provided excerpts; where explicit recommendations are given here, they are taken from the USPSTF text excerpts and the stated consensus for ages 50–75 [1][2][3].\n",
      "\n",
      "If you would like, I can summarize the USPSTF Table 1 characteristics or provide typical colonoscopy intervals and follow‑up recommendations — but I cannot provide those additional details unless they are present in the supplied source material.\n",
